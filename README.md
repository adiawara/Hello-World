# Hello-World

Demonstrate that you've successfully installed your programming language and environment of your choice 
by submitting a screen dump of a "print('Hello world')" program executing in your environment.  
We'll be writing some test cases in Assignment 1 so you may want to explore your choice of testing platforms this week but it's not required for this week.
